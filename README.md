# Botify
Mastodon Bot that post's your top 10 tracks in the Short, Medium and Long term to the timeline

# Usage

For this you'll need:
 - A spotify developer account, as well as an application. 
 - A mastodon account
 - Python3, including the modules, mastodonpy, requests, simplejson, spotipy

Run the export commands with the details from the spotify developer dashboard to add the client details to your env. This might require callback URLs as well
```
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=''
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=''
```

# Disclaimer

I wrote this bot as a hack in about an hour. There will be issues, the code is hacky. If you want to help fix them, please do.
